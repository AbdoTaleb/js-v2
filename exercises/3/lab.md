Lab questions
==============================

// Create each one these questions in separate functions that returns the appropriate type. 
// Use exercise.js to call the function and print out the result on separate lines.

1. Create an array with the length of 5 and holds the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Name the function "myFirstArray" and print out the result.

2. Create an array that holds the sentence: "Hello! My name is John Doe". Each of the words should have an own spot in the array, meaning the array length should be 6. Name the function "arraySentence" and print out the result.

3. Pass an array of your choice to a function that returns a boolean (true/false) if the argument is an array or not. Name the function "checkArray" and print out the result.

4. Create a function that merges two arrays into a new array and return it. Name the function "concArrays" and print out the result.

5. Pass an array of your choice to a function and reverse the order of the elements. Name the function "reverseArray" and print out the result.

6. Create a function that takes two arguments, an array and a value in the array. The function should return the index in the array that the value is found at. For example, if the arguments are: [1, 2, 3] and 2, the function should return the index of 2, which in this case is 1. If the value does not exist in the array, it should return -1. Name the function "findIndex" and print out the result.

7. Pass an array of your choice to a function and use a "forEach-loop" to count the items in the array. Name the function "countArray" and return the result.

8. Pass an array of your choice and use a "forEach-loop" to add an "x" to all elements in the array. Name the function "changeArrayElements" and print out the result.
