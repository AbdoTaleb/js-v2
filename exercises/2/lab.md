Lab questions
==============================
//Remember to include the "functions.js" before "exercise.js" in your .html-file!

1. Create a function that returns the sum of two numbers. The function should be called "sumNumbers" and take two arguments. Print out the result.

2. Create a function that returns the product of two numbers. The function should be called "productNumbers" and take two arguments. Print out the result.

3. Create a function that returns the sum of all numbers between two chosen numbers. The function should take two arguments, one representing the lowest boundary and one that represents the highest boundary. For example the arguments 10 and 20 should return the sum of 11+12+13...+19. Name the function "sumRangeNumbers" and print out the result.

4. Create a function that returns a phrase. If your name is "John", the returned phrase should be: "Hi John, how are you?". The argument should be a string that holds a name. Name the function "stringPhrase" and print out the result.

5. Create a function that gives an answer to the question "How are you?". The answer should be "I am fine". If the question is otherwise, the response should be "Try again". Name the function "stringResponse" and print out the result. 

6. Create a function that returns true or false (boolean) if a given number is higher than the other. The function should take two arguments, one argument that holds the value to check and another argument that holds the value to check with. For example the arguments 5 and 10 should return "false", because 5 is not higher than 10. If the arguments are 10 and 5, the result should be "true". Name the function "checkIfHigher" and print out the result.
